## üëÄ Overview

**nvs** (Neovim Version Switcher/Manager) is a lightweight cross-platform CLI tool written in Go üèóÔ∏è that makes it super easy to install, switch between, and manage multiple versions of Neovim and config on your machine. Whether you‚Äôre testing a cutting‚Äëedge nightly build üåô or sticking with the stable release üîí, **nvs** has got your back!

> [!note]
> I only have a mac and it's working perfectly fine for my use case. If it's not working for other OS, feel free to help fixing that or share it as an issue. I'll try to look into it.

## üåü Features

- **Easy Installation:**
  Download and install Neovim versions directly from GitHub with a single command.
- **Version Switching:**
  Switch between installed versions in a snap. **nvs** updates a global symlink so your preferred version is always just a command away.
- **Config Switching:**
  Easily toggle between Neovim configurations by scanning ~/.config (including symlinks) and setting NVIM_APPNAME interactively or via a direct subcommand argument.
- **Remote Version Listing:**
  List all available remote releases (stable, nightly, etc.) with cached results to avoid GitHub rate limits ‚ö°. Need fresh data? Just add the `force` flag.
- **Upgrade for Stable and Nightly:**
  Easily upgrade your installed stable and/or nightly versions. The upgrade command checks if you‚Äôre already on the latest version and only performs an upgrade if needed.
- **Uninstallation & Reset:**
  Remove individual versions or reset your entire configuration with ease. (Full cleanup? See the caveats! ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- **Cross-Platform:**
  Works on macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), Linux, and Windows.
- **Global Symlink Management:**
  Automatically creates a consistent global binary in `~/.nvs/bin` for a seamless experience.

## üöÄ Installation

Move the binary to your PATH or run it directly.

## üíª Usage

**nvs** uses a clean subcommand interface. Run `nvs --help` for full details.

> [!note]
> Remember to add `nvs` to your path. See next section about how.

### Commands

#### path

Best effort to automatically add the global binary directory to your PATH.

```bash
nvs path
```

#### install

Install a specific Neovim version.

```bash
nvs install stable    # Install the latest stable release üîí
nvs install nightly   # Install the latest nightly release üåô
nvs install v0.10.3   # Install a specific version
nvs install 0.10.3    # Or without the v keyword

# or with shorthand
nvs i stable
```

#### use

Switch to a particular version. This updates a global symlink in ~/.nvs/bin so that you can simply run nvim.

```bash
nvs use stable
nvs use nightly
nvs use v0.10.3
nvs use 0.10.3
```

> [!warning]
> If you're using windows, I think you will need `administrator` privilege terminal for **nvs** to symlink.

#### list

List available remote releases and installed status (cached for 5 minutes to avoid rate limiting). Use the force flag to refresh the cache.

> [!note]
> The list will be filtered out for only nightly, stable, all version that are above v0.5.0.

```bash
nvs list
nvs list force

# or with shorthand
nvs ls
nvs ls force
```

#### current

Display the currently active Neovim version.

```bash
nvs current
```

#### upgrade

Upgrade installed stable and/or nightly versions. If no argument is provided, both stable and nightly are upgraded (if installed).

> [!note]
> The upgrade command checks if the installed release is already up-to-date by comparing a stored identifier (release tag for stable, commit hash or published date for nightly). If no upgrade is needed, you'll be informed that you're on the latest version.

```bash
nvs upgrade         # Upgrades both stable and nightly if installed
nvs upgrade stable  # Upgrades only the stable release if installed
nvs upgrade nightly # Upgrades only the nightly release if installed

# or with shorthand
nvs up
nvs up stable
nvs up nightly
```

#### config

Switch between multiple configs. If no argument is provided, it will promp a select UI, else it will just open with specified name.

> [!note]
> It only scan the `~/.config` directory with names contain `nvim` in it. E.g. nvim, nvim-test, nvim-vanilla, ...

```bash
nvs config
nvs config nvim-test

# or with shorthand
nvs c
nvs conf
```

#### uninstall

Uninstall an installed version.

```bash
nvs uninstall stable
nvs uninstall nightly
nvs uninstall v0.10.3
nvs uninstall 0.10.3

# or with shorthand
nvs rm stable
nvs remove nightly
nvs un 0.10.3
```

#### reset

Reset to factory state.

> [!warning]
> This command will delete all data in ~/.nvs including items inside the bin directory, but will preserve the bin directory structure. Use with caution.

```bash
nvs reset
```

## üîó Adding **nvs** to Your PATH

To easily run the Neovim binary provided by **nvs**, you need to add the global bin directory (`~/.nvs/bin`) to your PATH. Below are instructions for common shells:

> [!note]
> We have provided `nvs path` command for the best effort to automatically setup the path for you in common shells. If it does not work, you need to set it up manually.

### Macos Or Linux

#### Bash

Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile` on macOS):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.nvs/bin:$PATH"
```

Then, reload your configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.bash_profile
```

#### Zsh

Add the following line to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.nvs/bin:$PATH"
```

Then, reload your configuration:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Fish

Add the following line to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```bash
set -gx PATH $HOME/.nvs/bin $PATH
```

Then, reload your configuration:

```bash
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

### Windows

Open an elevated Command Prompt (Run as administrator) and type:

```bash
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Users\YourName\.nvs\bin"
```

You may need to open a new Command Prompt session to see the updated PATH and try running `nvim`.

## üß© Shell Completions

**nvs** supports generating shell completions using Cobra‚Äôs built‚Äêin functionality. You can easily enable command completions for your favorite shell by following the instructions below.

### Bash

To enable Bash completions, add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile` on macOS):

```bash
source <(nvs completion bash)
```

Then, reload your configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Zsh

For Zsh users, first ensure that completion is enabled by adding the following to your ~/.zshrc (if not already present):

```bash
autoload -U compinit && compinit
```

Then add the following line to generate and load **nvs** completions:

```bash
source <(nvs completion zsh)
```

Then, reload your configuration:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Fish

Fish shell users can generate completions with:

```bash
nvs completion fish | source
```

To make the completions permanent, save them to your completions directory:

```bash
nvs completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/nvs.fish
```

Then, reload your configuration:

```bash
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

## üìÇ Configuration & Data

**nvs** stores its configuration, downloaded versions, and cache in the ~/.nvs directory.

> [!note]
> Remember: Homebrew will not delete this directory upon uninstallation, you must delete it manually if you want a full cleanup.
